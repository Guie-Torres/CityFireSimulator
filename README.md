# CityFireSimulator
Simulation of a city fire

Call whatever functions you want in the "Main" function.

The default name for a random building is "Pepa", while the value and number of floors are random.

Run SimFire(x, y) to simulate the fire, but it won't do anything if building at [x, y] is not made out of wood.
